Wales wing George North will play for the Ospreys next season, the Welsh Rugby Union confirmed on Wednesday. It was announced earlier this season that North would return to Wales from English Premiership club Northampton on a national dual contract, which he signed last November. And the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) have revealed that the Swansea-based Ospreys will be his destination. National dual contracts are funded 60 percent by the WRU and 40 percent by a player's regional team. And 73 times-capped North's signing is a major coup for the Ospreys after announcing Allen Clarke's appointment as head coach. North, 26, made his Test debut in 2010 and toured with the British and Irish Lions to Australia in 2013 and New Zealand last year. "I am really excited to be joining the Ospreys and starting a new chapter in my career when I return to Wales," North said in a statement released by the WRU. "I believe the Ospreys have an exciting future with the structure and the recruitment they have put in place, and I am really looking forward to linking up with Allen (Clarke) and the squad in the summer. "It was a really positive decision for me to sign a national dual contract with the support and structure it provides. I have worked alongside the WRU to finalise my choice of region, and I would like to thank everyone involved."
