German favourite Angelique Kerber was forced to retire injured from her third-round match at the Stuttgart Grand Prix on Thursday, with Estonia's Anett Kontaveit earning a 6-0, 2-0 win. Former world number one Kerber, who was treated off-court after going down 0-5 in just 17 minutes, was playing with her right thigh strapped.
