Outgoing Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger was warmly greeted by the Manchester United fans and presented with a gift by former United boss Alex Ferguson on his final visit to Old Trafford as Gunners' boss on Sunday. Wenger and Ferguson were fierce rivals for many years as Arsenal and United battled for Premier League supremacy in Wenger's first decade of a 22-year reign in charge. However, the tension between the two has since eased, and Ferguson greeted Wenger on the touchline before kick-off before presenting him with a glass momento alongside current United manager Jose Mourinho. Mourinho has also had his spats with Wenger, most famously decribing the Frenchman as a "specialist in failure" for his inability to win the Premier League since 2003/04. It was all smiles as the Portuguese and Wenger enjoyed a warm embrace before kick-off while Wenger was applauded by the United support. "There are some great clubs and some fantastic competition in the Premier League now, but United against Arsenal was great for the game. It made the Premier League," Ferguson told the United website. "Virtually every game we played against Arsenal, there was a real edge to the match. There were confrontations, because there were two teams and two managers battling for one award: the Premier League. "In my time, we had a few arguments but I always did really respect the man because he did a fantastic job at his club."
