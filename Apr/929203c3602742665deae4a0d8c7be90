Monegasque rookie Charles Leclerc beamed with delight on Sunday after he scored his first points in Formula One by finishing sixth for Sauber at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix. The young Monaco-born driver, a graduate of the Ferrari academy, kept out of trouble in a wild and chaotic race, after starting 13th on the grid. “It was an amazing race and I am very, very happy with the result,” said the 20-year-old, one of only a handful of men from the principality to have risen to F1. “It was so eventful, so many incidents on the track, that it was very challenging but it was fun to drive and I felt very good in the car. “It is an incredible feeling to score points in F1 for the first time. I feel like I won the race! Now we can look forward to doing it again and continuing on a positive path.”
