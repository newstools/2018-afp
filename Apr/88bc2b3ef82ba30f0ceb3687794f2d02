Sci-fi action flick "Rampage" topped North American box offices over the weekend to barely beat out horror film "A Quiet Place," industry figures showed Monday. "Rampage" stars hard-working Dwayne (The Rock) Johnson as a primatologist who befriends an albino gorilla which grows to enormous size after a rogue experiment and  then teams with Johnson to stop invading monsters. Naomie Harris co-stars. While the three-day $35.8 million take for the new Warner Bros film was said to be one of the best ever for a video game spinoff, it will need many weeks of strong showing to make its money back on a $120 million budget. "A Quiet Place," in its second week, took in a healthy $33 million, buoyed by rave reviews. The almost wordless Paramount production stars actor/director John Krasinski and real-life wife Emily Blunt as a couple silently struggling to protect their family from invading aliens that are blind but can track their prey by sound. In third place over the Friday the 13th weekend was yet another horror film, new Universal/Blumhouse release "Truth or Dare," which took in $18.7 million -- more than five times the movie's minuscule budget. The supernatural thriller stars Lucy Hale and Tyler Posey as spring breakers caught up in an innocent game that turns deadly. Steven Spielberg's "Ready Player One" -- a futuristic tribute to 1980s films  -- took in $11.5 million to cling to fourth place in its third week out. Its budget was a not-so-minuscule $175 million. The Warner Bros. film tells the story of a teenage gamer (Wade Watts) who finds himself inside an addictive virtual reality world. And in fifth was "Blockers," a raunchy comedy from Universal starring John Cena and Leslie Mann that netted $10.8 million. Rounding out the top 10 were: "Black Panther" ($5.8 million) "Isle of Dogs" ($5.5 million) "I Can Only Imagine" ($4.1 million) "Tyler Perry's Acrimony" ($3.7 million) "Chappaquiddick" ($3.1 million)
