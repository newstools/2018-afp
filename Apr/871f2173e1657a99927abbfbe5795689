In-form Daniel Ricciardo edged ahead of Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen to top the times in Friday's second free practice session for this weekend's Azerbaijan Grand Prix. The Australian clocked a best lap time of one minute and 42.795 seconds to outpace the Finn by just 0.069sec with his Red Bull team-mate Max Verstappen third, 0.116sec adrift. Ricciardo won last year's race on the high-speed Baku street track and also triumphed at the Chinese Grand Prix earlier this month. Verstappen's lap came as a welcome final outcome on another turbulent day which had seen him crash into the barriers during the opening practice in the morning. Finnish driver Valtteri Bottas, who was fastest in the morning session, wound up fourth for Mercedes ahead of defending four-time world champion Lewis Hamilton, and two-time champion Fernando Alonso of McLaren. Esteban Ocon of Force India was seventh, ahead of Carlos Sainz of Renault, Kevin Magnussen of Haas and Germany's Nico Hulkenberg in the second Renault. Verstappen has crashed at all three Grands Prix this season and came into this weekend under pressure to regain his composure and some consistency but slid his Red Bull car into the wall after only half an hour. He has been involved in a series of incidents this year. In Australia, he crashed and finished sixth. In Bahrain, he crashed in qualifying and collided with Hamilton in the race before retiring and in China he slid off in a misjudged attempt to pass Hamilton before crashing into Vettel.
