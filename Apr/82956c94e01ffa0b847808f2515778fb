Canadian Milos Raonic pulled out of the Monte Carlo Masters before his third-round match against Marin Cilic on Thursday with a right knee injury. The 14th seed, a former Wimbledon runner-up, struggled with the problem during his second-round win over Marco Cecchinato on Wednesday. Second seed Cilic progresses to a last-eight tie with either Italian qualifier Andreas Seppi or Japan's Kei Nishikori.
