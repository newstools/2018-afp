Prince William and his wife Kate's new baby son, named Friday as Prince Louis, is the 11th living British royal with the title prince. Seven are descended from Queen Elizabeth II and three are her first cousins. The other is her husband Prince Philip who, having renounced his titles as a Greek and Danish prince in order to marry, was created a British prince. As for great-grandchildren, Queen Elizabeth changed the rules in 2012 so that all the children of the eldest son of the prince of Wales would have the title prince or princess -- effectively meaning that all William's offspring would bear the style, not just his eldest son as before.
