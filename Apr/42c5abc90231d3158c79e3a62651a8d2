Estonia's Ott Tanak claimed his first win as a Toyota driver in the Rally of Argentina and third of his world championship career on Sunday with a commanding weekend performance. Tanak finished 37.7 seconds ahead of Belgium's Thierry Neuville in a Hyundai and 75 seconds in front of Spain's Dani Sordo in the second Hyundai. Five-time world champion Sebastien Ogier, who was fourth in an M-Sport Ford, maintains the overall championship lead having won in Monte Carlo, Mexico and Corsica already this season. "It'a a very special win," said Tanak who moved to Toyota from M-Sport in the summer. "We didn't know what was going to happen when we changed teams. But we have put in a lot of good work and it's great to see how quickly we have improved." Results: 1. Ott Tänak-Martin Järveoja (EST/Toyota Yaris) 3h43:28.9, 2.
