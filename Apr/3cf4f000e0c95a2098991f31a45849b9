Zinedine Zidane handed Gareth Bale his first Champions League start since September as Real Madrid prepared to face Juventus in the quarter-final second leg. Bale was a surprise inclusion ahead of Karim Benzema at the Santiago Bernabeu, where Real held a 3-0 advantage from the opening match in Turin. Sergio Ramos' suspension meant a call-up for 21-year-old Jesus Vallejo in central defence while left-back Marcelo assumed the captaincy. For Juve, Medhi Benatia and Miralem Pjanic returned after they were banned for the first leg. Mario Mandzukic started on the left of an attacking trio, alongside Douglas Costa and Gonzalo Higuain.
