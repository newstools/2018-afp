Six days after being knocked out in the qualifying round, Italian 25-year-old Marco Cecchinato made the most of a reprieve to reach the Hungarian Open final on Saturday. Cecchinato, ranked at 92 in the world, came from a set down to beat eighth-seeded compatriot Andreas Seppi 5-7, 7-6 (7/4), 6-3 to book a place his first final. "It is very strange because I lost last week (in qualifying) and tomorrow I will play the final," said Cecchinato who earned a place in the main draw as a 'lucky loser' after Serbia's Laslo Djere pulled out with an injury. "It was a tough match," Cecchinato told atpworldtour.com. "I know Andreas very well because we are friends, I have practised with him for so many years." In Sunday's final, Cecchinato will meet either 2017 runner-up Aljaz Bedene of Slovenia or Australia's John Millman. Their semi-final was level at a set apiece when bad light caused a suspension on Saturday.
