Former world number one and two-time Grand Slam title winner Lleyton Hewitt will come out of retirement again to play doubles at the Estoril clay-court tournament, organisers said Wednesday. Hewitt, 37, will play doubles with Australian compatriot Alex de Minaur, who is 18 years his junior. "We have a wild card, we have ex-number 1 Lleyton Hewitt...who will break his 'retirement' to play at the Estoril Open alongside countryman Alex de Minaur," organisers tweeted. Hewitt, who won the 2001 US Open and 2002 Wimbledon titles, retired in 2016 but played doubles this year in Brisbane and at the Australian Open, where he made the quarter-finals with Sam Groth, before returning to his full-time occupation of Davis Cup coach.
