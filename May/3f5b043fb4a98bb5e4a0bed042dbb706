German second seed Alexander Zverev swept past Canada's Denis Shapovalov 6-4, 6-1 on Saturday to reach the Madrid Masters final. The 21-year-old Zverev will face Austria's Dominic Thiem, the man who knocked out Rafael Nadal in the last-eight, in Sunday's championship match. Thiem, the fifth seed, had earlier defeated South Africa's Kevin Anderson 6-4, 6-2 in his semi-final. "This is the earliest I've finished all week," joked Zverev. "Now I don't know how to do for the next four hours."
