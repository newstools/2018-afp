Caroline Garcia continued her strong run on clay by easing past Spain's Carla Suarez Navarro on Thursday to make the Madrid Open semi-finals. After reaching the last four in Stuttgart a fortnight ago, Garcia is yet to drop a set in the Spanish capital as she beat Suarez Navarro 6-2, 6-3. France's world number seven registered 28 winners on Manolo Santana court and will now face either Maria Sharapova or Kiki Bertens for a place in Saturday's final. The French Open starts at Roland Garros in two weeks where Garcia carries the hopes of a nation to become the first woman to win the tournament since Mary Pierce in 2000 on the famous clay courts.
