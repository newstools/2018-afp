American Brice Garnett shook off an opening bogey to fire a three-under par 69 and maintain his slim lead after the third round of the Corales Championship on Saturday. The 34-year-old Garnett finished with five birdies, one eagle and four bogeys in a roller-coaster round that got him to 16-under 200 and a two-shot lead over Corey Conners. Both Garnett and Conners are looking for their first USPGA Tour wins. Conners, of Canada, had six birdies and a bogey for a five-under 67 to finish alone in second at the course in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic. He is trying to become just the third Canadian to win on the PGA Tour in the past three years, joining Mackenzie Hughes (RSM Classic) and Adam Hadwin (Valspar Championship). The first USPGA Tour event staged in the Dominican Republic featured a host of lesser lights fighting for a title while the world's top players competed at the World Golf Championships Match-Play event in Texas. American Tyler McCumber is in third after a five-under 67 to sit four strokes back of Garnett. Tom Lovelady shot a 68 for sole possession of fourth at 11-under, while Ireland's Seamus Power is tied for fifth with Americans Denny McCarthy and Seungsu Han, who are at 10-under 206.
