Japanese ski jumper Sara Takanashi followed up Saturday's record-breaking 54th World Cup victory by soaring to a second successive win at the final event of the season in Oberstdorf on Sunday. The 21-year-old, whose disappointing campaign had failed to produce a win before this weekend, leapt out to 102.5 metres on her second jump to beat Daniela Iraschko-Stolz by 11.6 points. Takanashi had started the season level with Austrian men's great Gregor Schlierenzauer on 53 World Cup triumphs, and despite struggling throughout the season, ended it on 55. Already-crowned overall champion Maren Lundby completed the podium behind Austria's Iraschko-Stolz, with exactly the same top three as Saturday. Takanashi's double saw her finish third in the overall standings, with Norwegian Lundby ending 412 points clear of Germany's Katharina Althaus at the top. "I'm very happy about my weekend, and I'm satisfied with today's competition," Takanashi told fis-ski.com. "Maren and Katharina were so strong during this season, so third place in overall World Cup is great." Results 1. Sara Takanashi  (JPN) 250.4 pts (99 + 102.5 metres), 2.
