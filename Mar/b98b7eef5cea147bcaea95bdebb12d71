Police said Wednesday they are investigating an alleged road rage attack on Corey Feldman, after the former child star reported being confronted and stabbed -- although he was uninjured. The 46-year-old actor and musician -- who appeared in cult 1980s movies including "Gremlins," "The Goonies" and "The Lost Boys" -- was given a check-up at hospital but no wound was found. "I'm in the hospital! I was attacked 2nite! A man opened my car door & stabbed me w something! Please say prayers 4 us! ????????" Feldman tweeted. "Thank God it was only myself & my security in the car, when 3 men approached! While security was distracted w a guy a car pulled & attacked! I'm OK!" Feldman said the attack occurred around 10:45 pm (1745 GMT) on Tuesday as he was waiting at a red light, bodyguard in the passenger seat, in the Los Angeles suburb of Tarzana, the LAPD confirmed. "My client's paranoid because he's got a lot of threats online, there's a lot of haters out there," his attorney Perry Wander was quoted as telling celebrity news website The Blast. He said Feldman "filed a formal police report that three young Hispanic males jumped out of their vehicle and attempted to instigate a fight with Mr. Feldman's security guard and... one of the males approached Corey Feldman's side of the vehicle opened his door and attacked him with a sharp object." Feldman drove himself to a hospital, according to LAPD spokesman Drake Madison, who said there was "no laceration to Feldman's abdomen." No stranger to controversy, Feldman announced in October he was planning a $10 million documentary to expose an alleged network of pedophiles working in Hollywood. The entertainer has long claimed his career was destroyed for campaigning against what he describes as a Hollywood pedophile ring that abused him as a child. The LAPD announced in November his allegations were beyond the statute of limitations and could not be investigated further.
