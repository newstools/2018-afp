World number one Roger Federer booked his spot in the fourth round of the ATP Indian Wells Masters by steaming past Filip Krajinovic 6-2, 6-1 on Monday. The 36-year-old Federer needed just 58 minutes as he overpowered the Serb with a brilliant display of serving and extended his perfect record this season to 14-0. He blasted six aces had one double fault and won 89 percent of his first serve points, losing just three points on his serve the entire match. Federer, who is the defending champion and trying to win a record sixth title in the California desert, was on the centre stadium for the third day in a row. His opening match on Saturday night against Federico Delbonis carried over into Sunday afternoon after heavy rains forced a postponement of several night matches. Federer has already won two titles in 2018, claiming his 20th Grand Slam crown by winning the Australian Open in January. In the next round he faces Jeremy Chardy who beat fellow Frenchman Adrian Mannarino 7-5, 4-6, 6-1.
