Seven-time Grand Slam winner Venus Williams moved a step closer to a possible showdown with her sister Serena with a 6-3, 6-4 victory over Sorana Cirstea in Indian Wells on Saturday. The 37-year-old American reached the third round where she will face either Serena or Dutch player Kiki Bertens, who followed Venus on stadium court. "It was looking scary in the second set so it was good to pull it out," Venus said. "She (Cirstea) played great points." Venus and Serena have played 28 times with the most recent being in the final of the 2017 Australian Open, when Serena won 6-4, 6-4. Their first meeting was at the 1998 Australian Open which Venus won 7-6 (7/4), 6-1. Serena leads Venus in their career head to head matches 17-11. Venus won 61 percent of her first serve points and broke Cirstea's serve six times in the 78 minute match. Venus is making her seventh appearance in Indian Wells and is the oldest player in the women's draw. "I still have a lot to give. I don't think my dad wants me to ever stop playing," the seven-time Grand Slam champion said.
