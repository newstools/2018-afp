England manager Gareth Southgate handed an international recall to Jack Wilshere on Thursday, while Burnley duo Nick Pope and James Tarkowski were called up for the first time for friendlies against the Netherlands and Italy later this month. Swansea's Alfie Mawson also earns a place in Southgate's squad for the first time, but there is no place for Chelsea captain Gary Cahill as he paid for a lack of game time in recent weeks. Arsenal midfielder Wilshere hasn't played at international level since England crashed out to Iceland at Euro 2016. England travel to face the Netherlands in Amsterdam on March 23 before hosting Italy at Wembley on March 27.
